# A Lesson in Lending 

Using data provided by LendingClub.com I created a business solution for this peer to peer lending company which allows investors to make a more informed decision when reviewing applicants.  Although, still a work in progress, I was able to pin point and recommend specific applicant attributes to create predictive models for decreased risk for investors.
